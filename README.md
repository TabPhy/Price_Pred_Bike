# Price Prediction for Used Motorcycles 🏍️💰

Welcome to the Price Prediction for Used Motorcycles project! Whether you’re buying or selling, this tool predicts the price of used bikes from popular brands such as BMW, Suzuki, Yamaha, Royal Enfield, KTM, and Ducati.

## How it Works 🔧

This project uses Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the price of your used bike based on a set of inputs. We use multiple state-of-the-art methods, including XGBoost linear, XGBoost BDT, CatBoost, Extra Trees, and AdaBoost BDT. The models are then combined using a Voting Regressor to give you the most accurate price prediction!

## What’s Inside? 🛠️

    •	Multiple ML models: The models used in this project are trained on a variety of bike features and prices, allowing you to get the best price predictions!
    •	Easy-to-use script: Just run the price_prediction.py script and enter the bike’s details – the models will take care of the rest. 🎉
    •	No hassle, no setup: You don’t need to be a Python expert to use it – simply follow the instructions to predict the price of your bike in USD 💵!

## How to Use 🔑

	1.	Clone this repository
  	2.	Double click or run the executable in Project/build/price_prediction ./price_prediction (if another system that MacOS is used, the script Project/price_prediction.py needs to be used. An interpretation of the exec for other systems will follow)
	3.	Enter the bike details (brand, age, condition, etc.) when prompted.
	4.	Get your price prediction from the trained models! 🎯

## Fun Features 🎨

	•	You can input details interactively via the terminal (yes, that means you can skip some values too 😉).
	•	Multiple models working together for super accurate predictions!
	•	Enjoy some fun ASCII motorcycle art along the way! 🏁

## Models Used:

	•	XGBoost Linear
	•	XGBoost BDT
	•	CatBoost
	•	Extra Trees
	•	AdaBoost BDT
